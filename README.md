Ansible role taskfile
=========

Install taskfile from https://taskfile.dev/#/


Role Variables
--------------
Set taskfile version via:
    taskfile_version: 3.2.2


Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      vars:
         - taskfile_version: 3.2.2
      roles:
         - { role: ansible-role-taskfile }
